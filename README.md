# Election_Analysis
## Overview of Election Audit: 
In this analysis the goal to the analysis is to do the following: 
1.	Pull the total number of votes and percentage votes (in votes and by county), select the county with the moth voter turnout 
2.	Pull the number of total and percentage votes for each individual candidate, the winner with the amount of votes and percentage
Using given data through a CSV file by utilizing python to write, read and execute code to perform the mentioned goals. 

## Election-Audit Results

    •	A total of 369,711 votes were casted in this local election 
  
    •	A breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct:

## Election-Audit Summary: 
The application for this code can also be modified to do the following:
* See what counties may not be participating as much in the election. By copying the same existing code for ‘winning’ and replacing the ‘winning’ portion with ‘losing’ in all code. This maybe iportant so that government authorities can target and promote voters to come out and actually vote. The only real additional work needed to be done for this is to create a logical operator for this equation.
* If we wanted to make this into a federal election, we would just need to adjust columns in the CSV file, depending on how specific someone is trying to read this code (by state or by region) amd adjust the code to fit the user's preference.
